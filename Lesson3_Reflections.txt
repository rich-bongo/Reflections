When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When multiple developers are working on the same code base, there needs to be a common repository for all developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because once you push to GitHub, other developers can access that code. So you'd want to control when that happens.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: cone of a repo on git hub- does not maintain a relationship with lineage
Clone: local copy of repo - does not maintain a relationship with lineage
Branch: Creates copy within repositiry, does maintain lineage.
